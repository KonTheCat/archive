# SpaceId to SourceId Consistency Update

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced "spaceId" with "sourceId" in backend/v1/search.py**:

   - Updated SQL query in vector search to use "sourceId" instead of "spaceId"
   - Updated page object references to use "sourceId" instead of "spaceId"
   - This ensures consistency with the naming convention used throughout the application

2. **Updated backend/utils/cosmos_setup.py**:
   - Changed partition key path from "/spaceId" to "/sourceId" in the compositeIndexes configuration
   - Updated the container creation parameter from "/spaceId" to "/sourceId"
   - This aligns the database schema with the application's naming conventions

These changes complete the renaming effort from "spaceId" to "sourceId" throughout the codebase, ensuring consistent naming across all components of the application. This follows the previous work documented in the container-naming-consistency.md log, which had already updated some files but missed these instances.

## Next Steps

- Monitor application logs to ensure the changes don't cause any unexpected issues
- Update any documentation that might still reference "spaceId"
