# AI Log - March 9, 2025 - OpenAI Authentication Fix

## Summary

Today I fixed an authentication issue with the Azure OpenAI client that was causing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to extract text and generate embeddings.

## Issue

The error message was:

```
Error code: 401 - {'statusCode': 401, 'message': 'Unauthorized. Access token is missing, invalid, audience is incorrect (https://cognitiveservices.azure.com), or have expired.'}
```

This error was occurring in the `VectorEmbeddingsHelper` class in `backend/utils/vector_embeddings.py` when initializing the AzureOpenAI client. The issue was that the client was being initialized with `azure_ad_token=credential`, which is incorrect. The DefaultAzureCredential object was being passed directly as a token, rather than using a proper token provider.

## Fix

I modified the `VectorEmbeddingsHelper.__init__` method to use the correct identity-based authentication approach:

1. Imported the `get_bearer_token_provider` function from azure.identity:

   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
   ```

2. Created a token provider using the DefaultAzureCredential:

   ```python
   token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
       credential, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
   )
   ```

3. Used the token provider with the AzureOpenAI client:
   ```python
   self.client = AzureOpenAI(
       api_version=self.api_version,
       azure_endpoint=self.api_endpoint,
       azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
       http_client=http_client
   )
   ```

This change ensures that the OpenAI client uses the correct authentication method with the proper audience for Azure Cognitive Services.

## Result

With this fix, the application should now be able to properly authenticate with Azure OpenAI and generate embeddings without encountering the 401 Unauthorized error. The text extraction process uses the vector embeddings helper to generate vector embeddings for the extracted text, which should now work correctly.
