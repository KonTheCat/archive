# AI Log - March 9, 2025 - Case-Insensitive Search Implementation

## Summary

Modified the search functionality to make text searches case-insensitive, improving the user experience by returning more relevant results regardless of text casing.

## Work Completed

### Backend Changes

1. Updated SQL queries in `backend/v1/search.py` to use case-insensitive matching:

   - Modified the source search query to use `LOWER()` function on both the field values and the search query:

     ```sql
     WHERE CONTAINS(LOWER(c.name), LOWER(@query)) OR CONTAINS(LOWER(c.description), LOWER(@query))
     ```

   - Modified the page search query to use `LOWER()` function on all searchable fields:
     ```sql
     WHERE CONTAINS(LOWER(c.extractedText), LOWER(@query)) OR CONTAINS(LOWER(c.notes), LOWER(@query)) OR CONTAINS(LOWER(c.title), LOWER(@query))
     ```

## Technical Details

- Used Cosmos DB's `LOWER()` function to convert both the field values and the search query to lowercase before comparison
- This ensures that searches will match content regardless of case differences
- The frontend already had case-insensitive highlighting using the `gi` regex flag in the `highlightSearchTerms` function
- Vector search remains unaffected as it's based on semantic similarity rather than exact text matching

## Benefits

- Improved search experience for users who may not match the exact case of content
- More comprehensive search results that don't miss relevant content due to case differences
- Consistent with user expectations for modern search functionality
