# AI Log - March 9, 2025 - Vector Search Implementation

## Summary

Today I implemented vector-based search capabilities for the Personal Archive project. This enhancement allows users to search for content using semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching, providing more relevant search results.

## Work Completed

### Backend Implementation

1. Created a vector embeddings helper module:

   - Implemented `backend/utils/vector_embeddings.py` to generate vector embeddings using OpenAI's API
   - Used a singleton pattern for efficient resource management
   - Added support for both Azure OpenAI and standard OpenAI APIs
   - Implemented DefaultAzureCredential for authentication

2. Updated Cosmos DB setup for vector search:

   - Modified `backend/utils/cosmos_setup.py` to add vector embedding policy and vector index
   - Added vector index configuration with quantizedFlat type for efficient vector search
   - Configured the vector index with cosine distance function and 1536 dimensions

3. Extended Cosmos DB client for vector search:

   - Created `backend/utils/cosmos_db_extensions.py` to add custom query capabilities
   - Implemented methods for executing queries on spaces and space_documents containers
   - Added support for parameterized queries

4. Updated text extraction to generate vector embeddings:

   - Modified `backend/v1/text_extraction.py` to generate vector embeddings during text extraction
   - Stored vector embeddings in the page document alongside extracted text

5. Added vector search endpoint:
   - Updated `backend/v1/archive.py` to add a search endpoint with vector search capabilities
   - Implemented both traditional full-text search and vector search options
   - Added support for configurable result limit

### Frontend Implementation

1. Updated API service for vector search:

   - Modified `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to add vector search parameters
   - Added support for configurable result limit

2. Enhanced search page with vector search controls:

   - Updated `frontend/src/pages/Search.tsx` to add vector search toggle
   - Added dropdown for configurable result limit
   - Improved UI with better organization of search controls

3. Updated Page model:

   - Modified `frontend/src/types/index.ts` to include contentVector field

4. Added search relevance visualization:
   - Implemented relevance score display as a percentage
   - Added progress bar to visually represent relevance
   - Sorted search results by relevance when using vector search
   - Converted vector distance to a percentage score for better user understanding

## Technical Details

- Vector embeddings are generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
- Vectors are stored in Cosmos DB with 1536 dimensions
- Vector search uses the VectorDistance function in Cosmos DB SQL queries
- The search endpoint supports both traditional full-text search and vector search
- The number of search results is configurable with a default of 10
- Search relevance is displayed as a percentage with a visual progress bar

## Next Steps

- Fine-tune vector search parameters for better results
- Add more advanced search filters
- Implement caching for frequently searched queries
