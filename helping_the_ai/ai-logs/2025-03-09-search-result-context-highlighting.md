# AI Log - March 9, 2025 - Search Result Context Highlighting

## Summary

Enhanced the search functionality to display context around matched search terms, showing approximately 10 words before and after each match with the matched term highlighted. This improves the user experience by providing more relevant context for search results.

## Work Completed

### Frontend Changes

1. Modified the `highlightSearchTerms` function in `frontend/src/pages/Search.tsx` to:

   - Extract a context window of approximately 10 words before and after each match
   - Highlight the matched term within this context
   - Display multiple matches with line breaks between them (limited to 3 matches per result)
   - Add ellipsis to indicate truncated text

2. Added fallback behavior:
   - If no match is found, display the first 100 characters of the text
   - If the regex test passes but no matches are found during execution, return the original text

## Technical Details

- Used regex to find all occurrences of the search term in the text
- Implemented word counting by tracking spaces and newlines to determine context boundaries
- Added visual separation between multiple matches with `<br/>` tags
- Limited the number of displayed matches to 3 to prevent overwhelming the UI
- Added ellipsis indicators to show when text is truncated at the beginning or end of the context

## Benefits

- Provides more focused and relevant context around search matches
- Improves readability by showing only the relevant portions of text
- Maintains the existing highlighting style for matched terms
- Helps users quickly identify why a particular page was included in search results
