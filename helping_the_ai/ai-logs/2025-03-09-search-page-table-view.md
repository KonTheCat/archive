# AI Log - March 9, 2025 - Search Page Table View Implementation

## Summary

Modified the search results page to display only page results in a table format instead of tiles, and ensured the relevance percentage is displayed for vector search results.

## Work Completed

### Frontend Changes

1. Updated the Search page to focus on Pages only:

   - Modified `frontend/src/pages/Search.tsx` to default to showing only page results
   - Removed the tabs for "All Results" and "Sources"
   - Simplified the UI to focus on page content

2. Changed the display format from tiles to a table:

   - Replaced the card-based grid layout with a structured table layout
   - Added appropriate table headers: Image, Date, Relevance (for vector search), Content, and Actions
   - Maintained the thumbnail image display in a more compact format
   - Preserved the content preview with search term highlighting

3. Enhanced the relevance display:

   - Ensured the relevance percentage is prominently displayed for vector search results
   - Maintained the visual progress bar to represent relevance
   - Kept the existing relevance calculation logic that converts vector distance to a percentage

4. Improved overall readability:
   - Structured data in a consistent tabular format for easier scanning
   - Maintained all existing functionality while improving the presentation

## Technical Details

- The table view provides a more structured and information-dense presentation of search results
- The relevance percentage is calculated using the same formula: `Math.round(Math.max(0, Math.min(100, (1 - similarity / 2) * 100)))`
- Vector search functionality remains unchanged, with results sorted by similarity
- The UI still supports toggling between regular and vector search
